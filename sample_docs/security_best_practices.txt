Title: Security Best Practices

1. Credentials Management
NEVER commit secrets, API keys, or passwords to Git. Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager. If a secret is leaked, it must be rotated immediately.

2. Least Privilege Access
Access to production servers and databases is restricted. Developers should use the "Break Glass" procedure to request temporary prod access via Teleport, which requires approval.

3. Data Privacy
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as emails, phone numbers, and addresses must be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and masked in logs.

4. Laptop Security
All employee laptops must have full-disk encryption enabled (BitLocker/FileVault). Screen lock should trigger after 5 minutes of inactivity. endpoint protection (CrowdStrike) must not be disabled.
