Title: Work From Home (WFH) Policy

1. Hybrid Work Model
We observe a hybrid work model. Employees are required to be in the office for a minimum of 3 days a week. The specific "in-office" days are determined by individual team leads to ensure collaboration overlaps.

2. Core Hours
While we offer flexibility, all employees must be reachable during "Core Hours" from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time, regardless of their work location.

3. Remote Work Infrastructure
Employees working from home must ensure they have a stable internet connection (minimum 50 Mbps) and a dedicated quiet workspace. The company provides a one-time WFH allowance of $500 for setting up a home office (chair, monitor, etc.).

4. Fully Remote Requests
Requests for permanent full-remote status are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Department Head and HR, typically approved only for senior individual contributor roles or health reasons.
