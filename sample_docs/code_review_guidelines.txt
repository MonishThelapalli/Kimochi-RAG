Title: Code Review Guidelines

1. Scope of Review
Code reviews should focus on logical correctness, performance, security, and maintainability. Style and formatting should be handled automatically by pre-commit hooks (Black/Prettier).

2. PR Size limit
Pull Requests (PRs) should be kept small to facilitate effective review. A soft limit of 400 lines of code change per PR is recommended. Larger features should be broken down into stacked PRs.

3. Turnaround Time
The expected turnaround time for a code review is 24 hours. If a PR is critical/blocking, label it as "Urgent" on GitHub and notify the team in Slack.

4. Comments Etiquette
- Be constructive and polite.
- Distinction between "Nitpick" (optional) and "Blocker" (mandatory fix).
- Suggest code snippets for fixes where possible.
- Approve explicitly when all comments are addressed.
