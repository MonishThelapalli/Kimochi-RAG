Title: Deployment Guidelines

1. Deployment Schedule
Production deployments are restricted to Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM UTC. No deployments are allowed on Fridays ("Read-Only Fridays") or weekends unless it is a P0 hotfix.

2. CI/CD Pipeline
All code must pass the standard CI/CD pipeline on Jenkins/GitHub Actions. This includes:
- Unit tests (min 80% coverage)
- Linting (Black/Flake8 for Python)
- Integration tests
- Container vulnerability scan (Trivy or Snyk)

3. Approval Process
Any merge to the 'main' branch requires at least one approval from a Senior Engineer. Production deployments require a "Go/No-Go" approval from the QA Lead and the Engineering Manager on the #release-ops Slack channel.

4. Rollback Strategy
Every deployment must have an automated rollback plan. If error rates exceed 1% or latency spikes by 50% within 15 minutes of deployment, the automated rollback script is triggered immediately.
